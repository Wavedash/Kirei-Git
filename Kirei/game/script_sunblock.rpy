    "Oops."

    t "Why are you asking me?"

    t "Aren’t you the vampire expert?"

    "Since when did I become an expert?"

    mc "I’m just wondering what you know."

    show tomo sass with dissolve

    t "Are you trying to impress Kirei with some brand new facts?"

    "I shake my head."

    "She smirks and puts down her pencil."

    "As if Tomo would know something that I won’t know."

    show tomo hip happy with dissolve

    t "Aren’t they allergic to garlic salt or something?"

    mc "Garlic, yeah. There's plenty of sources for vampire lore though. Some legends don't mention garlic. Sometimes they can turn into bats. Some stories include some weird rules about running water."
    mc "But there are a few common themes in all the legends."
    mc "They drink blood and can't go out into sunlight."

    show tomo glare with dissolve

    t "Sunlight? I know that's one of the legends, but come on. There's no way sunlight would take out a vampire."

    mc "How do you mean?"
    
    t "You'd think after thousands of years and modern technology they'd figure out ways around something as simple as sunlight, wouldn't you?"
    
    mc "Like?"

    t "Sunblock.{w=.5} Duh."

    "Is she even serious right now?"

    "She taps me on the forehead."
    
    t "They're not real."

    "Tomo and I share a quiet laugh."

    mc "Well you brought it up."
    
    t "Well think about it. What are they supposed to do? Stay inside all day with the curtains drawn?"

    "I shrug my shoulders."

    show tomo chestnut with dissolve

    t "Like, how do they get their groceries?"
    t "It’s not like there are too many places that are open at night."

    mc "Do vampires even eat regular food?"
    mc "I mean, they're undead right?"
    
    t "What does that even mean? Undead?"
    t "It's dumb. You can't be alive and dead."
    t "I’m sure they’d need their other vitamins and minerals."
    t "And their proteins and fats."

    show tomo sass with dissolve

    t "Just not the garlic flavored kind."

    "Poor vampires."
    "They’re missing out."
    
    show tomo hip happy with dissolve

    t "Did Kirei manage to teach you anything new?"

    mc "Nothing that I couldn’t have figured out on my own."

    show tomo sass with dissolve

    t "Yeah, I’m sure you already know all there is to know."
    t "You probably spent all of last night researching vampires."

    "I nod admittingly."
    "She’s almost right."
    "I was thinking about that shadow."

    show tomo hip quizzical with dissolve

    t "So your excuses suck. You don’t deserve to be sleepy."

    mc "I told you about that shadow, right?"

    mc "I had to figure out what that was."

    show tomo glare with dissolve

    t "Doesn’t matter. You spent the whole night on the internet!"

    t "Slacker."

    mc "And what are your reasons?"

    show tomo sad with dissolve

    t "I... had a bad dream."

    "How is that excuse any better than mine?"

    mc "Aww, poor baby."

    "I put on my most insincere sympathy face."

    mc "What was it about?"

    show tomo worry with dissolve

    t "I can hardly remember."
    t "It felt like something was chasing me, but I was chasing something."

    mc "So you were running a marathon?"

    show tomo happy with dissolve

    t "I was definitely running, that’s for sure."
    t "But where I was going, I have no idea."

    "Talking about running brings back bad memories of P.E. class."

    "Yeesh."

    show tomo armdown quizzical with dissolve

    t "So Kirei actually let you in her apartment?"

    mc "Yeah, believe it or not."

    mc "It was actually a pretty impressive place."

    show tomo glare with dissolve

    t "I’ve known you for longer, and I don’t think I’m letting you anywhere near my house."

    t "Y’know... stuff."

    mc "You know, if you got to know her, you might actually like her."

    t "I don’t hate her..."
    t "It’s just..."

    t "What do you think she’s after?"

    "I shrug."

    "Some excitement?"

    "A break from the normal world."

    mc "I don’t believe in them."
