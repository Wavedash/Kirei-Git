Please... no...
Don’t leave me.
I... I don’t want to be lost again.
So why are we headed to the park?
I heard a rumor of a vampire attack there last night.
Wouldn’t the police be all over the place?
Vampires don’t tend to leave messes behind.
And you think we’re gonna be able to find some clues?
It’s worth a shot, right?
Sure. We should head out right now.
Let’s not.
Why not?
There’s bound to be people there.
We don’t want to look weird scouring the park while there’s people around.
We should go later at night.
We can head out soon.
We won't be spotted.
Hey, Kirei?
Hm?
Why are you so interested in vampires?
I mean, not that it's a bad thing.
I'm just curious.
That's a good question.
She searches for an answer.
I guess you could say I find them fascinating. The whole thing.
Humans and supernatural beings.
The relationship between the two.
What does it mean to be human?
That's... much deeper than I expected.
Now come on. Let's get going. It'll be dark by the time we get there.
And with that, we were on the hunt.
I’ve lived near this park my whole life.
I can’t believe something like a vampire attack could happen so close to me.
It’s kind of unsettling at this hour.
Some of the street lights aren’t even on.
Well, let’s get investigating.
Kirei scans her flashlight along the pathway.
I begin to search around as well.
What is it exactly that we should be looking for?
Anything out of the ordinary.
A slight breeze blows by.
Things like bloodstains, signs of a struggle.
Anything out of place?
This park looks about the same as it always had at night.
It is pretty hard to see out here right now.
It’s so dark.
Find something?
Nothing yet.
Man, I have no idea what I should be looking for.
I’m almost certain blood would’ve dried up by now.
Most clues would’ve been picked up by the police.
If there were any clues to begin with.
This better not be some prank.
Popular Kirei finally snaps her trap on the unpopular kid.
No... Kirei wouldn’t do that.
We’re out here investigating.
And... failing.
Another breeze makes me shiver.
I sigh as I stoop down to check below a bench.
I don’t feel quite like myself right now.
It’s dark... and cold.
And I'm actually a little bit uneasy.
The overcast clouds block what moonlight is actually here.
And the park lights are dimming, too.
Suddenly, I remember the shadow from before.
I can't decide which is sillier: Believing in vampires and dismissing the shadow...
Or trying to convince myself I saw nothing when I'm out here looking for vampires.
Hey, [protag]?
I stand back up and look around to find the source of her voice.
I can hardly see.
It’s just so dark.
Y-yes... Kirei?
I can hear her moving closer to me.
There...
There she is.
The bell rings loudly in my ear.
Where am I?
Oh.
I must’ve dozed off.
I stretch.
Math has always been boring, but sometimes the teacher can just drone on forever.
What’s the point of giving a lecture on precalc, anyway?
I let out an unintentionally loud yawn.
A stifled giggle floats from across the room.
I'd recognize that laugh anywhere.
Tomo. I’ve known her since we were freshman.
She’s been my friend since we started high school.
We don’t have much in common, but for some reason, we really click.
It's lucky for me. I don’t make friends well.
Lately, we’ve been spending a lot of time together.
More than usual since the beginning of our last semester.
Guess it all falls into place when your schedules are exactly the same.
As a matter of fact, we have the next class together, too.
Hey, you!
My view is suddenly obstructed.
I look up and recognize her face but a name doesn’t immediately come to mind.
She’s one of the popular girls on campus. Definitely not on my level of social class.
Why is she talking to me?
She looks excited.
Hey, you okay there?
She drops her books on my desk to capture my attention.
Huh? Uh... yeah, I’m fine.
Can I ask you a question?
She taps her fingers together and looks me in the eye.
You’re into that paranormal stuff, right? 
Like ghosts and zombies and all that?
I nod slowly.
Last week, I brought one of my hunter magazines to class.
"Hunter," as in ghost hunter.
It fell out of my bag in class and I've gotten hell for it ever since.
It’s not like I’m addicted to the stuff. I just... dabble.
But I suppose if someone like her wants to talk about it, I wouldn’t mind so much...
Oh, I can’t believe I’ve forgotten your name...
I wonder if she knew it in the first place.
She sighs and pokes her cheek.
Oh well. I didn’t expect her to know it anyway.
It's [protag].
Right! [protag]! I won’t forget it.
And you’re Kirei, right?
Yeah, that’s her name. Most everyone in school knows it.
She nods and reaches her hand out to me.
What is this girl even after? My vote for class president?
No. That wouldn't make sense. We’ve only got a few months of school left.
As I grab her hand to shake, she squeezes mine and giggles.
So... have you heard about the recent vampire sightings?
Vampires, huh? Never really piqued my interest.
Of course, typical for a girl to be interested in vampires.
Probably some skewed fantasy of romance and drama.
But of course I’ve heard about the sightings.
I read it on a blog
Er... The news. I saw it on the news.
Smooth, [protag]. Just show her how much of a dork you are. Blog? Really?
They were talking about how there had been strange sightings in the area before the murders.
Bats, and strange shadows. Shady figures and pale skin.
And the victims...
Isn’t that just fascinating?
Er...
Who is this girl again?
"Little miss popular" Kirei? "Loved and adored by the entire student body" Kirei?
I guess even the normal ones have their dark secrets. 
And I guess it’s pretty cool that it’s coming from Kirei.
Most girls like her would never give me the time of day.
Do you wanna hang out with me after class today? I’ve got something I’d like to show you.
Show me what?
Is this even happening right now?
I’ve seen her around almost all year, but...
She’s actually talking to me.
I’ve got nothing else to do today.
Goddammit. Should have gone with, "Oh. I'd love to, Kirei". What is wrong with me?
Great. Text me after school lets out?
She grins softly and slides me a sheet of paper.
A phone number.
Sure thing.
I fold the paper.
So what was that about, [protagchan]?
I stand up to meet Tomo and sling my backpack around my shoulder, as we both walk out of the classroom on our way to the next period.
You know that girl, Kirei?
What would Little Miss Popular want with you?
Hey!
I nudge Tomo with my elbow.
What wouldn’t a pretty girl like that want with me?
...
...
No idea. But she gave me her phone number.
I smile as I type it into my phone contacts.
I don’t know about this, [protagchan].
What’s not to get? A girl gave me her phone number.
Isn’t that a little... y’know, odd?
I’d take offense to that if she wasn’t entirely right.
But who knows? It could be my lucky day.
I mean...
Yeah, she seems nice... but what do you think she’s after?
She said she’s interested in the recent vampire sightings.
Unlike some people I know...
Tomo sighs.
I don't really know much about vampires, but they seem interesting enough.
It's not like I've never seen a vampire movie. I just don't spend my free time reading about them.
If someone like that's interested, though, I may as well take a look, right?
Just watch your back, okay? What if she’s a vampire?
Sure. And I'm the pope.
Hey now, you never know.
She's only been here for a year. How do you think she could she have become so popular so fast?
By not having a super-abrasive personality?
Hey!
Tomo giggles a bit.
Hell, if I ever met a vampire that pretty, maybe I wouldn’t mind her taking a bite out of me.
Another sigh.
Typical.
I smirk.
Tomo hates it when I talk about girls.
Do you even know what it's like to be bitten?
I haven’t met a vampire, so no.
I meant in general, dummy.
Still a 'no'. Why, do you want to bite me?
Don’t tempt me.
So, I’m guessing we’re not hanging out after class today?
I’m not sure.
I mean, Kirei just gave me her number.
Maybe it won’t be such a big deal, though.
I’ll see what she wants, and then call you to let you know if I’m free.
...
She doesn’t look too thrilled.
Hey now, we’ll hang out tomorrow.
Promise.
We’d better.
Ah. there we are.
I’ll just send Kirei a text.
I scroll through my contacts.
It doesn’t take long. I only have four people in my phone.
hey where do you want to meet
I pack up my belongings.
Suddenly, I’m feeling a bit of panic.
What if this is all some sort of sick joke?
What if she
Meet you at the park entrance.
Well, I guess I’ve already dug myself a hole.
My reputation can’t possibly get any worse.
Despite what Tomo had to say, I’m going along with this.
It’s kinda strange.
We spent the entirety of lunch discussing something that probably isn’t even real.
I had a lot of fun with it.
And so the rest of day goes on.
The final bell.
Finally.
Hey, [protag], we’re still gonna... um... hang out today, right? Just you and me?
Yeah, sounds good.
Y’know, it has been a little while since the last time I had some one on one time with her.
Something must be bugging her. She seemed different today.
Tomo sighs loudly as we walk.
Something on your mind?
We kinda need to talk about something.
Is this about Kirei? What’s the matter, are you jealous?
She sighs.
No! That’s not it.
Then what’s the issue then?
It’s about... Um... Kirei...
I sigh.
Of course it is.
And what about her?
I... I don’t know, I just  don’t think you should be spending so much time with her.
Of course she doesn’t. I tune out for a bit. This isn’t worth me listening to.
Nobody tells me who I can and can’t be friends with.
She has no reason to be talking about Kirei.
She hardly even knows her!
Why can’t she just accept the fact that I can make new friends?
Is she actually jealous?
I just don’t understand why she isn’t willing to give her a chance.
Why she isn’t willing to give me a chance.
What’s gotten into you, Tomo?
[protag], are you even listening to me?
Tomo puts her hands on my arms and looks me in the eyes.
She’s never looked this sincere before.
Kirei’s bad news, okay? Just... please, stay with me.
I-I...
Just then, I feel a hand on my shoulder.
I instinctively turn around to see Kirei smiling at me.
I smile back at her.
Hey, [protag], oh... is this your friend? Hi, I’m Kirei.
She offers Tomo a handshake.
Hmph.
Tomo crosses her arms.
Could she be more immature?
Okay, then. You don’t mind me stealing our little [protagchan] for a second, do you?
Kirei pulls me close to her and whispers in my ear.
Let’s meet in the park after school today.
She smiles as grabs my hand and leads me away.
N-no... [protagchan].
Her voice falters.
Her words break.
Some friend she turned out to be.
We walk further away from Tomo.
I’m sorry for earlier.
Tomo’s not usually like that.
Oh, it’s not a problem.
Kirei smiles and waves it off.
Tomo’s been different lately.
A little more worried about me.
She’s got nothing to worry about.
I’m fine on my own.
And she should be fine on hers.
Are you feeling alright?
[protag]...
Wake up...
Man. I can't move.
There’s something on top of me.
Someone...
Kirei?
A laugh.
My neck feels wet...
And my back feels drenched.
My heart’s pumping so fast.
And it’s cold. I feel so cold.
I need to open my eyes.
Oh, wonderful! You’re still with me!
Kirei? Is that..?
She's covered in blood!
A shot of pain courses through my body as she brings a hand to my neck.
She brings her hand back up in front of my face.
It’s stained a dark red.
You're surprisingly concious right now.
I won't act like I'm not impressed. You've lost a lot of blood, after all.
I’m bleeding?
She... she bit me!
And I'm gonna die.
Oh my god, I'm gonna die!
Please... please, no.
Not like this...
What's the matter, [protagchan]?
That's an awful mark on your neck.
You...
Shall I kiss it and make it better?
Kirei puts her mouth on my neck and drinks gently.
Mmm...
I feel...
Oh, my poor [protagchan].
You’re such a damn fool.
But at least you found your vampire. You can take comfort in knowing that you're not crazy.
You... the shadow...
Hm..?
She was tricking me...
Just not how I expected...
You're so easy to manipulate.
Like putty.
And you fell for it.
Vampires...
I never expected to be right...
What about... you said before... about a person's soul...
A soul. HA!
Lot of good that did you.
What's so special about a damn soul?
No...
But you said...
Do you even have a...
Do I have a soul? Of course I do.
At least I think I do...
She grabs my hair and pulls my head up.
But when you look at it from my point of view...
It's just so much more fun to give in.
Human feelings? Vampire instinct?
What’s the difference?
We’re all just acting on our desires... for our own selfish reasons.
It’s nothing personal, [protagchan].
I've only been like this for a year or so.
I thought maybe you'd know something about vampires that would be useful.
We don't exactly have instructional meetings, you know.
I thought maybe you'd be a bit of fun.
She shrugs.
I guess not.
You’re just like everyone else.
Completely useless.
Well...
Not entirely useless...
She puts her hand to her face and inhales.
Ah...
Blood tastes so much sweeter when accompanied by fear.
I... I can’t move.
I can’t get her off me.
And so, my [protagchan], I'm going to tell you something.
I'm going to kill you.
But then, I think I'll snack on your friend, too.
Tomo!
No... Please...
I can feel my back getting wetter and wetter with my blood.
This is how it ends?
I'm sorry, Tomo...
Oh, and [protag]?
Can I ask you a question?
Just one last exchange before you have to go?
Why did you decide to spend time with me in the first place?
Wh-what?
Is it because you think I’m pretty?
I heard you talking to that brat.
You said you wouldn’t mind me taking a bite out of you...
If I were pretty enough.
[protagchan].......  am I pretty enough for you?
That was a little more awkward than it should have been.
I wonder what's gotten to her.
At least morning classes are over.
Tomo's still mad, it looks like.
Hey.
I’ll see you later.
Yeah...
I can’t blame Tomo for not wanting to come along.
If I’ve learned one thing in high school...
It’s that not everyone’s a fan of this kind of stuff.
Fortunately, I know someone that is.
I'm pretty sure Kirei’s class is right down the hall.
I pass by a handful of people on their way out the door.
Room 112...
I think this is it.
Yup.
And there’s Kirei.
Sitting at her desk, eating an apple.
She waves me over to her.
She’s got a book open on her desk.
Hey, you.
She smiles at me as I sit down across from her.
What are you reading?
Vampire novel.
Not with the sparkly...
Kirei laughs a bit.
Of course not.
This one’s pretty grisly.
What, vampires tearing humans apart?
Nope.
Vampires versus vampires.
Is that even a thing?
That’s crazy.
Well, the one vampire used to be a human.
A vampire hunter actually.
And... his hunts weren’t all too successful, I’m guessing?
Right, so the only way he could actually defeat a vampire was to become one himself.
Losing his identity in the process.
Sounds like the hunter was too obsessed with his prey.
I felt more like the hunter was making a noble sacrifice.
Well when you put it that way, I guess he was doing a justice.
But at what cost?
Kirei takes a bite out of her apple.
Could you imagine being a vampire?
She shakes her head.
It must suck.
Really, [protag]? It sucks?
Kirei snickers and shakes her head.
Stupid puns.
I swear I didn’t mean to.
Vampirism is a curse.
Could you imagine?
After the hunter becomes a vampire, he’s just kinda stuck like that.
He’d be dependent on blood.
He’d feel alienated from his old friends and family.
Y’know... not too different from me.
Aside from the whole blood part.
Kirei finishes her apple and flips back through the book.
Did you know that vampires don’t have reflections either?
Of course I did.
Soulless creatures with nothing else to live for except killing.
If they’re still even alive.
Are vampires considered living beings?
Or are they like really smart zombies?
Y’know, that’s a pretty good question.
Kirei’s silent for a bit while she thinks.
I’d say they’re alive.
Why so?
Well, they have feelings and emotions, right?
Do they?
I’ve always known vampires to be the cool, collected type that are strictly business.
Well, if a human can become a vampire, then they’re sure to be somewhat human-like.
So you're saying they still have a soul, then?
A soul?
Hmm...
I'd imagine. At least I think so.
How does that vampire hunter character act in the book?
Dunno. The book ends after he kills the other vampire.
Well that’s lame.
So you said that vampires can’t be killed by humans?
Well, I’m sure it’s possible.
But vampire versus vampire seems like a more fair fight.
Probably more entertaining too.
Oh... wow, lunch is over?
Time flies, right?
I’ll see you later, [protag]. This was fun.
I’d best be heading back to my class.
Kirei and I both pack up our things before leaving the room.
The park Kirei was talking about is Circle Park.
It's on the way back home.
On the way to a lot of things, actually.
Like the name implies, it's smack in the middle of town, and despite being called a "park", it's actually huge.
A forested area with a ton of hiking trails and some clearings here and there where the park "features" are.
But if you want to get across town on foot, the fastest way from point A to point B is through park C.
I used to play here as a kid, but now I just pass through it on my way to school.
Kirei's waiting for me at the gate.
She waves and walks to meet me.
Hello, [protag]!
Thanks for meeting up with me.
Uh, hi.
It's no trouble.
I look around. I'm still expecting the hidden camera crew to jump out at any moment.
Well then... shall we?
I nod and stand up and walk by her side.
So far, so good.
She hasn’t shown signs of cold feet.
And it doesn’t look like I’m gonna get tarred or feathered.
I’m walking home with one of the most popular girls in school.
And she’s actually talking to me.
We walk around for a while.
She tells me about how her family came to town from a larger city.
If I'm being honest, I don't really hear much of what she's saying. Her voice is kinda mesmerizing in that cartoon princess sing-song kinda way.
And I’m fortunate enough for my parents to be paying rent.
I can’t believe she invited me over.
I’m sorry if my place is a mess. I’ve just been very busy lately.
She fiddles with her keys as she pushes the door open with her body.
Her apartment isn’t even dirty.
Well, at least not compared to my room.
Quiet colored walls.
Basic furnishings.
A spot of trash here and there, but otherwise, immaculate.
Make yourself at home. Need anything to drink?
No thanks.
Are you sure?
Kirei walks over to her fridge and opens it, revealing a wonderful array of drinks and food.
I raise my hand to decline, but...
Wow.
She’s really lucky if she gets to live on her own like this.
I’d have to wait until college before I get to live by myself.
She takes a juice for herself and crashes onto her couch in the corner of the room.
And your parents pay for all of this?
They have been for the past year now.
Doesn’t it get lonely?
Kinda. But that’s why I appreciate having company over.
And my parents do visit on occasion.
But they’re currently out of the country on a business trip.
Business trip?
I look at the view of the town from the window.
This is a really nice apartment.
Her parents must be rich.
So... since you’re the expert here... What do you know about vampires?
Expert? Me?
They uh, drink blood, right?
I move closer to the couch and sit down next to her, setting my backpack near my feet.
Come on, [protag]. Even I knew that.
What does she want to hear?
A Transylvanian accent?
They’re super strong and cunning.
Sharp teeth.
A weakness to garlic and silver...
...and a common practice of killing them was driving a stake through their heart.
Whoa.
Kirei almost has this strange smile on her face.
Tomo was never really interested in the violent details.
I’m actually a bit excited I’ve got someone to talk to about this stuff.
Oh, right. I’ve got something to show you.
Kirei flips through an open book on top of her coffee table.
It says here, 'Humans unwittingly interact with vampires on a daily basis.'
Hiding in plain sight is a classic vampire M.O...
The finest trick of the devil is to persuade you he doesn’t exist.
So... you could be friends with a vampire, and you wouldn’t even know it!
I shake my head.
Pff... doubt it. I don’t have too many friends to begin with.
Kirei stifles a laugh.
Why would a vampire want to be friends with a human anyway?
We’re so boring.
We’re not as strong or as fast as them.
Wouldn’t it make sense for them to just be after our blood?
Kirei shrugs and tilts her head.
Vampires are people too, right?
I’d be lonely too if I had to kill a quarter of the people I’ve met.
When you put it that way, I guess a vampire would need a support group.
Talk about Hemoholics Anonymous.
Hello, my name is Dracula, and I’m a hemoholic.
Kirei looks at me, confused.
Oh man, that was stupid.
...
Kirei giggles softly.
Hopefully that wasn’t a pity laugh.
My self-confidence is already shot as it is.
Do you think humans would consciously befriend vampires?
You’d think the answer would be no.
It’s not?
No, I meant, having a vampire friend could have its perks.
It’s like being friends with a superhero, or a police officer.
Except superheroes and police officers wouldn’t suck your blood.
Neither would a good friend, right?
Not if they were the two last living things on Earth.
People do extraordinary things in extraordinary circumstances.
And I don’t think I’d put friendship in front of survival.
Then again, like I said...  I don’t have too many friends to begin with.
Well... better to have them as a friend than an enemy, I suppose.
...
Kirei pulls out a short stack of newspapers and magazines.
I spent the majority of the early afternoon reading what she had to offer.
Historic occurrences of vampirism.
A tuft of police and medical reports describing incidents of mutilated victims.
And of course the good handfuls of phony magazine articles.
‘Vampire Wins Local Chess Tournament by Mind Reading.’
Credible or not, I still had a pretty good time.
Kirei yawns and stretches.
Wow... it’s getting pretty late.
Is that my cue to leave?
Oh, no, you don’t have to.
I check my watch.
It’s probably about time I’d get home.
I’m pretty sure math homework isn't gonna do itself.
I stand up and pick my backpack up from the floor.
Oh, and [protag]?
Can I ask you a question?
Just one last exchange before you have to go?
I turn around to hear her out.
Yeah, what is it?
Why did you decide to come with me today?
What kind of question is that?
Is it because you think I’m pretty or popular?
Because you didn’t think I’d be into these sorts of things?
Of course she’s super pretty and popular.
But... that can’t be the only reason, right?
Think, [protag]...
N-no... it’s not that.
I don’t have too many people to talk to about this stuff.
Hell, I don’t have too many people to talk to at all.
It’s just...
A lot of people know who I am...
But you’re the one of few who has actually taken the time to get to know me.
You’d think a girl as popular as her would have tons of friends.
Turns out she’s just as lonely as the rest of us.
Kirei looks at me and smiles.
So, thank you [protag].
I’ll see you out.
Kirei stands up and follows behind me.
I’ll see you tomorrow, [protag]. Stay safe.
Kirei smiles as she waves from her door.
Well, she certainly had a lot to share.
Never really had her pegged as someone like me.
Just going through the motions, with a whole different kind of person on the inside.
I enter the park gates - quickest way home and all that.
It’s a bit chilly for April, but the sun sets behind the clouds as I walk.
The cold air feels a bit thin to breathe.
My feet hit the pavement at a rhythm unfamiliar to me.
The park paths are fairly empty, but people are here nonetheless.
A couple of kids in hoodies, keeping to themselves.
What if... they’re vampires?
Oh man, now I’m on edge.
They look up at me, but I can’t quite make out their faces.
I look back down to avert my eyes.
When I see them pass out of my periphery, I look back up to find the path out to my street.
The sun tips over the horizon.
As I pull my head up, I see some dark form in the distance.
A-a shadow?
It stands there... almost flickering.
Blowing in the wind.
Stealing my breath.
I rub my eyes and the silhouette is gone.
...
I look around and pick up the pace, anxious to get home.
My footsteps quicken as I hold my backpack tighter to my person.
That... shadow.
Whatever the hell that was...
Probably nothing, right?
It’s just been a long day.
Probably my eyes just playing tricks on me.
My heart’s beating fast. I’m not sure if it was just from me walking faster, or if I’m actually scared.
At least I’m home now.
I unlock the door and slide inside.
I flip a couple of lights on and make my way to the living room.
Surprisingly, my parents aren’t home yet. 
I check the clock.
Oh.
I thought it was a lot later on in the day.
I drop to my bed and close my eyes.
What was that shadow from earlier?
Ah!
My phone caught me completely off guard.
I fumble around my pocket.
It’s Tomo.
Hello?
[protag]... hi.
Hearing her voice, even through a static filter of the phone, is comforting, for some reason.
I hear her let out a heavy sigh.
Need something?
N-no, nothing. I just wanted to talk.
Aww, that’s cute.
You actually miss me.
And there’s Tomo’s signature scoff.
Yeah, I just got home from Kirei’s house.
Oh yeah, how was that?
She’s...
How do I put this...
More interested in vampires than I am.
I hear Tomo lightly giggle.
Didn’t even think that’d be possible.
I sigh.
Hey! I’m not that bad, am I?
You’re the only one I know who visits the websites you do.
That’s because I’m probably her only friend.
[protag]? Are you still there?
Wha? Oh, yeah, I’m still here.
Something on your mind?
Yeah... that unnerving dark visage.
The splotch of black.
I saw something today.
You did? Like what?
I don’t know what it was... some shadowy looking thing.
Like a dark blur.
Tomo goes quiet for a bit. Her tone becomes a bit more solemn.
S-seriously?
No joke.
It was just standing there for a split second.
Then it disappeared.
I froze up when I saw it.
You’re okay though, right?
Yeah, just a bit startled, maybe.
I hear her sigh again.
Well, I’m glad you’re okay.
Just... remember to do your homework.
Yeah, totally not doing that.
Yeah, whatever.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah, of course.
I’ve been feeling a little preoccupied about the shadow since I got home.
Couldn’t really enjoy dinner.
Don’t think I plan to tell my parents.
They’d get way too excited about the Kirei news.
So I decide to stay quiet about the whole issue.
I laid in my bed thinking of that shadow I saw earlier.
If I try to shut my eyes, they’d snap right back open.
It was just too dark.
All I see are shadows.
Sleep isn’t coming easy tonight.
I reach for my nightstand.
Let’s see what the Internet has to say...
Agh! Bright!
I rub my eyes vigorously.
Crap. I forgot to do my homework.
Where are they?
I race towards the tree line.
Freezing in my tracks, I spot them.
I’m... I'm too late.
The creature laughs loudly as it takes a bite.
I can’t watch this.
There’s so much blood.
I should have paid more attention.
I should have noticed....
I'm so sorry, [protagchan].
Shit, she must’ve heard me.
Ah!
I see you finally decided to show your face again.
...
Whats the matter? You were never the quiet one before.
She wipes the blood from her mouth.
You...
My blood begins to boil.
You took... From me...
Oh my, I’m sorry. Was this yours?
I didn’t realize it had your name on it.
Everything is wrong.
A pretty girl like you doesn’t need someone like that anyway.
Everything...
Everything is...
She’s smiling.
Truth be told, from the beginning, I had no intention of killing [protagchan] if it proved useful.
Don't...
Don't you dare say that name!
Now now. Weren't you just using your 'friend' as well? You're just like me.
Well, save for the blood and gore.
She licks her fingers.
Like her? I’m...
She... doesn't realize...
I’m nothing like you!
Then tell me... why did you come here?
I-I...
Like always, following like a puppy on a leash.
Spending so much time with your dear friend.
...
What a shame.
Your tears tell me enough.
Well farewell, Tomo.
Enjoy your life.
Or what's left of it.
I don't have room for dessert right now, but you're still on the menu.
I'll see you later.
I... can’t believe you’re gone.
Why am I crying?
Why did I have to care for such a simple human?
I knew this was inevitable anyway...
I just didn’t expect it to come so soon.
You... should have listened, [protag].
I told you not to trust her.
I didn't think she was like me...
You’re gone now.
My only tie to this human world.
My only friend...
Gone.
What am I now?
Am I just like her?
...
That’s the curse I’ve been bound to...
And the fate that I’ve been trying to escape from this whole time.
Nothing can hold me back any longer.
I enjoyed the time we had together, [protag]... even if this was supposed to happen... one way or another.
You were supposed to be mine, but... she stole you away.
This... this was your blood.
But... don’t worry, [protagchan]... She’s not getting away that easy.
I swear it.
I’ll kill her.
Where are they?
I race towards the tree line.
Freezing in my tracks, I spot them.
I’m... I'm too late.
The creature laughs loudly as it takes a bite.
I can’t watch this.
There’s so much blood.
I should have paid more attention.
I... I could have done something.
I could have stopped this.
Uuuuungh.
Only a couple more months before I don’t have to come back here.
I walk up the stairs and through the open door.
I didn’t recognize her from behind but I pass by Kirei.
She spots me.
Oh, good morning [protag]! How are you doing today?
She’s awfully chipper.
Can’t complain. Couldn’t sleep much last night, but that’s nothing special.
I yawn to cement my point.
What are you doing for lunch today?
Not much, I guess.
Would you like to have lunch with me? We could read up on more vampire things if you’d like.
I found a couple new books in the school library this morning.
The library? Does anyone even go there anymore?
Well, I guess it’s bound to have something I haven’t seen before.
I sincerely doubt it.
I shoot her a sour look.
She playfully taps me on the head.
But how about it?
I shrug.
Can’t hurt, could it?
I might learn something new.
Sure.
Great! I usually have lunch in Ms. Koh's classroom.
It's nice and quiet. Perfect for reading.
Alright.
I’ll see you then!
Kirei smiles and walks off to her class.
Speaking of class...
I enter the room and spot Tomo.
She waves lazily.
I take my seat next to her.
Morning.
You look tired.
Hardly got any sleep last night.
Felt like I was running around everywhere.
Looks like the sleepiness is contagious.
The teacher sets his bag down at the front desk and lecture begins.
I’m definitely not in the mood to hear about evolution right now.
I seriously can’t wait to graduate and be done with this place.
Tomo can read the apathy on my face.
Hopefully the teacher can’t.
I look up at him quickly.
He’s got his back to the class and is writing on the board.
Now would be a perfect time for a nap.
So dark.
The surface of the desk chills my face.
Why does the teacher have to talk so loud?
This isn’t working.
I lean over to Tomo.
Is class almost over yet?
Not yet, but we’re doing group work.
Oops.
Pull your weight, you bum.
I smirk at her and sit up straight in my desk.
So... what do you know about vampires?
Tomo scoffs and shakes her head.
I know they’re not real.
You don’t know that for sure.
Why are you asking me?
Aren’t you the vampire expert?
Since when did I become an expert?
I’m just wondering what you know.
Are you trying to impress Kirei with some brand new facts?
I shake my head.
She smirks and puts down her pencil.
As if Tomo would know something that I won’t know.
Aren’t they allergic to garlic salt or something?
Garlic, yeah. There's plenty of sources for vampire lore though. Some legends don't mention garlic. Sometimes they can turn into bats. Some stories include some weird rules about running water.
But there are a few common themes in all the legends.
They drink blood and can't go out into sunlight.
Sunlight? I know that's one of the legends, but come on. There's no way sunlight would take out a vampire.
How do you mean?
You'd think after thousands of years and modern technology they'd figure out ways around something as simple as sunlight, wouldn't you?
Like?
Sunblock. Duh.
Is she even serious right now?
Would that even work?
How should I know?
She taps me on the forehead.
They're not real.
Tomo and I share a quiet laugh.
Well you brought it up.
Well think about it. What are they supposed to do? Stay inside all day with the curtains drawn?
I shrug my shoulders.
Like, how do they get their groceries?
It’s not like there are too many places that are open at night.
Do vampires even eat regular food?
I mean, they're undead right?
What does that even mean? Undead?
It's dumb. You can't be alive and dead.
I’m sure they’d need their other vitamins and minerals.
And their proteins and fats.
Just not the garlic flavored kind.
Poor vampires.
They’re missing out.
Did Kirei manage to teach you anything new?
Nothing that I couldn’t have figured out on my own.
Yeah, I’m sure you already know all there is to know.
You probably spent all of last night researching vampires.
I nod admittingly.
She’s almost right.
I was thinking about that shadow.
So your excuses suck. You don’t deserve to be sleepy.
I told you about that shadow, right?
I had to figure out what that was.
Doesn’t matter. You spent the whole night on the internet!
Slacker.
And what are your reasons?
I... had a bad dream.
How is that excuse any better than mine?
Aww, poor baby.
I put on my most insincere sympathy face.
What was it about?
I can hardly remember.
It felt like something was chasing me, but I was chasing something.
So you were running a marathon?
I was definitely running, that’s for sure.
But where I was going, I have no idea.
Talking about running brings back bad memories of P.E. class.
Yeesh.
So Kirei actually let you in her apartment?
Yeah, believe it or not.
It was actually a pretty impressive place.
I’ve known you for longer, and I don’t think I’m letting you anywhere near my house.
Weirdo.
Tomo sticks a tongue out at me.
She actually had a lot of things to share.
Books I haven’t seen before.
And these crazy photos and reports.
Awesome stuff.
What are you, in love with her?
You're just hilarious.
We’re actually getting lunch together. Wanna join us?
I... I don’t know. I’ve got other things to do.
She looks away nervously.
Like what?
Y’know... stuff.
I’ve known her long enough to know that she’s lying to me.
Is this about Kirei?
Tomo looks down.
You know, if you got to know her, you might actually like her.
I don’t hate her...
It’s just...
Tomo lets out a frustrated sigh.
What do you think she’s after?
I shrug.
Some excitement?
A break from the normal world.
Maybe she’s actually interested in the stuff.
Certainly seemed like it yesterday.
And how exactly did yesterday go?
We had a good time talking about vampires. I told you this.
Are you sure she’s just not playing you?
I had my suspicions at first... but really?
You honestly think I’m that gullible?
Last I checked, you’re gullible enough to believe in all of this supernatural crap.
I don’t believe in them.
Then why do you keep spending time with Kirei?
Is it wrong to have an interest in vampires?
Come on, you should know me better.
Tomo opens her mouth like she's going to say something, but stops.
I don’t want to hear anything more about vampires.
You know I hate that supernatural garbage.
It makes me sick.
She stands up and moves to another table.
Tomo stayed relatively quiet for the rest of classes.
If I had to talk to her, I stayed away from the topics of Kirei or monsters.
